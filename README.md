**&#x2695; No `for` loop in clinical trial simulation &#x2695;**

`TrialSimulator` is a system for declaratively implementing clinical trial simulations, inspired by the modular grammar of trial design. You provide the components—arms, endpoint-generation rules, milestones, and analysis methods—specify how they are combined under fixed or adaptive designs, and `TrialSimulator` takes care of the details, allowing you to focus on the design while it handles the mechanics.

`TrialSimulator` gives users full freedom to specify how trial data are generated and how analyses are performed. To make this process more convenient, it also provides a suite of helper functions: for data generation, utilities to sample endpoints from common distributions; for analysis, implementations of widely used methods such as group sequential tests, graphical multiple testing procedures, combination tests, and closed tests. These tools are optional but make it easier to construct and evaluate complex trial designs without sacrificing flexibility.

## Shiny App

An online version of this app is hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://bx7ttm-han-zhang.shinyapps.io/trialsimulatorstarter/). 

## Validation

The validation documents for this R package are hosted [here](https://github.com/zhangh12/TrialSimulatorDocuments) and are continuously updated.

## Installation

### Release

You can install the current release version from `CRAN` with:

install.packages("TrialSimulator")
```

### Development

You can install the development version from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/zhangh12/TrialSimulator) with:

``` r
if (!require("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github(
  "zhangh12/TrialSimulator", 
  build_manual = TRUE, 
  build_vignettes = TRUE, 
  force = TRUE
)
```

## Getting Started

`TrialSimulator` is designed with a modular architecture, allowing users to systematically construct and simulate clinical trials in a structured and flexible manner. The simulation process is broken down into three key steps:

1. **Defining Endpoints**: Specify the treatment endpoints that will be evaluated throughout the trial.
2. **Specifying Milestone**: Establish the conditions under which specific milestones (e.g., interim analysis, futility assessment, or stopping rules) will be triggered.
3. **Defining Actions for Milestones**: Determine the appropriate actions to be taken once a milestone is triggered, such as adjusting enrollment, terminating treatment arms, or conducting statistical analysis.

To efficiently utilize `TrialSimulator` for clinical trial simulations, we recommend reading the following vignettes in order:

- Define endpoints and arms
  - [Time-to-event (TTE) endpoints](https://zhangh12.github.io/TrialSimulator/articles/defineTimeToEventEndpoints.html)
    - [Simulate correlated PFS and OS](https://zhangh12.github.io/TrialSimulator/articles/simulatePfsAndOs.html)
  - [Non-TTE endpoints](https://zhangh12.github.io/TrialSimulator/articles/defineNonTimeToEventEndpoints.html)
  - [Longitudinal endpoints](https://zhangh12.github.io/TrialSimulator/articles/defineLongitudinalEndpoints.html)

- Examples: fixed design
  - [Design with correlated endpoints, and custom data generator](https://zhangh12.github.io/TrialSimulator/articles/fixedDesign.html)
