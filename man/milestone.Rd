\title{Define a Milestone}
\usage{
milestone(name, when, action = doNothing)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{character. Name of milestone.}

\item{when}{condition to check if this milestone should be
triggered. It taks value returned from functions \code{calendarTime()},
\code{enrollment()}, \code{eventNumber()} or their logic combinations.}

\item{action}{function to execute when the milestone triggers.
If no action to be executed but simply need to record triggering time and
number of events/non-missing observations of endpoints at
a milestone, \code{action} can be its default value, a built-in function
\code{doNothing}.}
}
\description{
Define a milestone of a trial. This is a user-friendly wrapper for
the class constructor \code{Milestones$new()}. Users who are not familiar with
the concept of classes may consider using this wrapper directly.

A milestone means the time point to take an action,
e.g., carrying out (futility, interim, final) analysis for
adding/removing arms, or stopping a trial early.
It can also be any more general time point where trial
data is used in decision making or adaptation. For example, one can define a
milestone for changing randomization scheme, sample size re-assessment, trial
duration extension etc.

to learn how to define milestones when performing simulation using
\code{TrialSimulator}.
