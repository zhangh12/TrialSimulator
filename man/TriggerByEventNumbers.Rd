\title{A trigger_condition function}
\usage{
TriggerByEventNumbers(
  trial = NULL,
  event_name,
  endpoints,
  target_n_events,
  arms = NULL,
  meet = c("all", "any")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{trial}{a \code{Trial} object.}

\item{event_name}{character. Name of event. It should be the same as
\code{Event$get_name()}.}

\item{endpoints}{character vectors. Endpoints to compute event numbers.}

\item{target_n_events}{target event numbers for \code{endpoints} to trigger
the event.}

\item{arms}{a vector of arms' name on which the number of events is counted.
By default it is \code{NULL} if all arms are used. Sometimes one may want to
count number of events on a subset of arms in a trial, for example, after
an arm is removed, number of events to trigger the next event/action may be
based on the remaining arms only.}

\item{meet}{\code{'all'} if all target event numbers need to be met before
triggering the event. \code{'any'} if triggering the event when the first
target is met for corresponding endpoint.}
}
\value{
data lock time (calendar), so that the `Event` class can lock data.
}
\description{
A trigger_condition function to find data lock time when target event numbers
are met for specified endpoints. This can be passed to trigger_condition
when creating an `Event`.
