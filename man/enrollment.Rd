\title{Triggering Condition by Number of Randomized Patients}
\usage{
enrollment(n, ..., arms = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{integer. Number of randomized patients.}

\item{...}{subset conditions compatible with \code{dplyr::filter}. Number
of randomized patients will be counted on subset of trial data only.}

\item{arms}{vector of character. Name of arms on which the number of patients
is counted. If \code{NULL}, use all arms that are not yet removed from the
trial by the time of calculation.}
}
\value{
an object of class `Condition`
}
\description{
Define a condition to trigger trial milestone by the number of randomized
patients. The milestone will be triggered when a trial has enrolled
at least the specified number of patients. It can be used combined with
conditions specified by \link[TrialSimulator]{calendarTime} and
\link[TrialSimulator]{eventNumber}.

Refer to the
\href{https://zhangh12.github.io/TrialSimulator/articles/conditionSystem.html}{vignette}
to learn how to define milestones when performing simulation using
\code{TrialSimulator}.
}
\examples{

## ensure sufficient sample size of whole trial
enrollment(n = 100)

## ensure sufficient sample size in sub-group of interest
enrollment(n = 100, biomarker1 == 'positive' & biomarker2 == 'high')

## ensure sufficient sample size in high dose + placebo
enrollment(n = 1000, arms = c('high dose', 'placebo'))
