\title{Extending Duration of a Trial}
\usage{
set_duration(trial, duration)
}
\arguments{
\item{trial}{a trial object returned by \code{trial()}.}

\item{duration}{new duration of a trial. It must be greater than the current
duration.}
}
\description{
set trial duration in an adaptive designed trial. New duration must be
longer than the old one. All patients enrolled
before resetting the duration are truncated (non-TTE endpoints) or
censored (TTE endpoints) at the original duration. This helps maintain
proper type I error or family-wise error rate and control multiplicity when
conducting testing statistics. For more
details of why this is necessary, please refer to
[Jorgens et al. 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pst.1926).

Note that this function should only be called within action functions of
milestones. It is users' responsibility to ensure that and
\code{TrialSimulator} has no way to track it.

This is a user-friendly wrapper of the member function of trial, i.e.,
\code{Trials$set_duration()}, which is used in vignettes. Users who are not
familiar with the concept of classes may consider using this wrapper
directly.
