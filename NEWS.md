# TrialSimulator 0.96.0

## Update

- Update mechanism of simulating dropout time. Switching from trial level to patient level, i.e. dropout time is now the time from a patient is enrolled until leaving a trial. This aligns with common practice and popular softwares. 

# TrialSimulator 0.95.0

## Update

- Add vignette of action function. 

# TrialSimulator 0.94.0

## New Feature

- Add function `summarizeMilestoneTime` and its plot method to summarize triggering time of milestones. 

# TrialSimulator 0.93.0

# TrialSimulator 0.82.0

## New Feature

- The function `fitCoxph` now supports `formula` to compute log hazard ratio or hazard ratio as main effect of `arm`. It will detect whether arm's main effect is specified in formula. It allows covariates and interaction between covariates and arm. However, only the main effect of arm is tested and returned. 
- Add unit tests for `fitCoxph`. 

# TrialSimulator 0.81.0

## New Feature

- The function `fitLogistic` now supports computing log odds ratio, odds ratio, risk ratio, and risk difference using `emmeans` contrast, in the presence of covariates. 
- Add unit tests for `fitLogistic` and `fitLinear`.
